    to fit within the given rect, word-wrapping as necessary. The text
    will be anti-aliased.

    Takes the following arguments:

    string - the text you wish to render. \n begins a new line.
    font - a Font object
    rect - a rectstyle giving the size of the surface requested.
    text_color - a three-byte tuple of the rgb value of the
                 text color. ex (0, 0, 0) = BLACK
    background_color - a three-byte tuple of the rgb value of the surface.
    justification - 0 (default) left-justified
                    1 horizontally centered
                    2 right-justified

    Returns the following values:

    Success - a surface object with the text rendered onto it.
    Failure - raises a TextRectException if the text won't fit onto the surface.
